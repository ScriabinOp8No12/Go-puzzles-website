Alex Ideas to 3 questions:

1. Learn Flask, 2nd server (python server) for executing python script, JS server calls this python server, then it executes the thumbnail script

2. Running Katago -> have it in a bash file, convert sgf to json format, then pass to bash command, then runs katago app as a subprocess, passing those arguments and commands, it'll run it in the background. Maybe in JS can wait for subprocess to finish. Usually JS just waits for subprocess to terminate, then JS will move onto next line

3. Manually test visits with 10 different puzzles
