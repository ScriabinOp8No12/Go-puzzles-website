            Now that you know how to place stones and how to surround territory,
            we will explore one of the most interesting parts of this game,
            capturing stones! But first we need to learn how to capture stones.

          <ul className="spaced-list">
          <li>
            A <span className="important-text">liberty</span> is any{" "}
            <span className="important-text">straight line</span> coming off of
            the stone or stones
          </li>
          <li>
            To <span className="important-text">capture</span> a stone, you must
            take away <span className="important-text">all</span> of the
            liberties
          </li>
          <li>
            Captured stones, also known as{" "}
            <span className="important-text">prisoners</span> or captures (less
            common term) are <span className="important-text">removed</span>{" "}
            from the board{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            During the counting/scoring phase of the game, prisoners are placed
            into your <span className="important-text">opponent's territory</span> (counts against their total territory)
          </li>
          <li>
          Terminology: <span className="important-text">Atari </span> (uh-tar-e) means the stone or stones are one move (liberty) away from being captured.
            If you play in person, you'll often hear teachers say "Atari" to help new players learn, but this not mandatory to say.
            Outside of the learning phase, it's probably not the best strategy to help your opponent out! ðŸ¤£
