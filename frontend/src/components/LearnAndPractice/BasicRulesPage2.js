              Welcome to the interactive tutorials for the game of Go! Go is the
              best game in the world (Iâ€™m definitely not biased). ðŸ˜Š
            </p>

            <p>
              As you start learning the rules and progressing through the ranks,
              youâ€™ll start to admire the beauty and depth of the game. Youâ€™ll
              also realize how much smarter you are than your friends who play
              chess or checkers. ðŸ˜‰{" "}

              <li>
                Go is almost always a 2 player game, where each player takes
                turns placing stones on the board.
              </li>
              <li>
                The player with the black stones typically plays first, and the
                player with the white stones plays next.
              </li>
              <li>
                Stones are placed on the intersections (where 2 lines meet) and
                not in the squares.
              </li>
              <li>
                The goal of the game is to surround territory, which is the
                number of intersections that you have surrounded.
              </li>
              <li>
                The player with the most territory at the end of the game wins!
