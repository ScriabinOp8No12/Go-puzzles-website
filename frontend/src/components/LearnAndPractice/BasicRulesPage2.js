            If you answered 4 points for each group (A, B, and C), you are
            correct! Nice job. ðŸ˜€ Notice how you needed 4 stones to surround 4
            points with group C, 6 stones to surround 4 points with group B, and
            8 stones to surround 4 points with group A.

            On the next page, we will practice scoring a game to see who won.  And then we will move on to learning about
            capturing stones, one of the most fun parts of this game!
