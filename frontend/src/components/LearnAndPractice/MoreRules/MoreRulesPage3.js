              this means both players are alive.

              Diagram 1: Black and white's groups marked at A and B are{" "}
              <span className="important-text">both alive</span> even though
              neither player has 2 eyes. Whoever places a stone at a triangle
              first gets immediately captured by the opponent at the other
              triangle. Both players can choose to never place a stone at either
              of the triangles, which means both players are just alive.

              Diagram 2: Here's another example of a seki - notice how if either
              player places a stone at the triangle, they can get captured.
