TEST FIRST

1. Copy uploaded SGF, delete all comments
2. Split SGF into different SGFS, with SGF going up to, but not including the mistake moves
3. Add correct move in to replace the actual game move, add a comment inline
that reads "CORRECT"
4. If there are more than 1 correct move, add comment to end of SGF (create new line)
with KataGo move converted into SGF move with a comment of "CORRECT"
4a. The bottom most comment gets two )) the rest get one )
5. Create glift standard problem type with initial position set to go to the move before the mistake
so this will be one move before the last move in the sliced SGF
6. Keep same alert for correct and incorrect moves

7 (would be really nice to implement!). Add the "next sgf" button as seen on glift,
so we can click that arrow to go to the next puzzle!

Looks like we need to add a button to the glift instance, then use an onclick event
to go to the next sgf in the array, so we need to define all the sgfs at the beginning of the file!

Then we see a right arrow at the bottom of the puzzle, which goes to the next once
This can be used to go to the next puzzle SGF that was created

Maybe KataGo can analyze these puzzles at higher visits while the user is solving the previous puzzles
