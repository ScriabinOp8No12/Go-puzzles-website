<!-- 1. Take picture of turtle drawing logo (as well as other animals!) and use as logo image

2. Add image of Go board and AI demo to the right side of the screen (under h2)

3. Add dummy / rough pages for top menu items

4. Add CSS hover effect (EVENT LISTENER?) for top menu (and add drop down menu for certain items like 'learn to play Go') -->

4a. Allow users to look through the game, add a button that allows them to store that specific move as a puzzle
for later. Also allow users to have AI analyze the game for the biggest point mistakes. Give users the option to categorize the puzzles they save (ladder/net, forcing move, reading, direction, judgment, sacrificing, etc.)

5. Learn server stuff for storing user's SGFs on backend, and using fetch to grab them

6. Start looking through Katrain docs to learn how to do the following

- Have Katrain analyze the game and output the moves where the 3 largest point mistakes were made per game

- Have Katrain analyze 10 move sequences to see where the greatest point losses were

- Figure out how to put Katrain on the website and have an interactive board that you play against it on

7. Add a timer and options to change speed of byo-yomi timers for the puzzles you play against Katrain on

8. Store other player's SGFs of puzzles in the database, and categorize them by type (also add a search by category feature to the "browze puzzle" link at the top of the page)

9. Set up payment for using the website (Server costs going to be high)
