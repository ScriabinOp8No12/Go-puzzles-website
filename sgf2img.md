Plan:

Use sgfmill to parse the SGF for the moves, I don't really care about the order, since the thumbnail just needs the first 30 moves of the game thrown onto an image

Use Pillow to draw the black and white stones onto the Go board (which I also create with Pillow)
then save that as an image, that's now my thumbnail!
