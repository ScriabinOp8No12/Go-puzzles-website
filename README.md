I am thankful for my wonderful teachers at App Academy for helping me on my endless bugs and coding problems during bootcamp office hours.
I am also very grateful to my Mom, Dad, and twin brother for listening to my endless rants regarding ridiculous bugs, and for brainstorming the best approach to solving problems.

I've been wanting to build this Go website for more than 2 years now, and through App Academy, I have finally been able to build it! I began building this website at the end of May 2023, and anytime I learned something new, I would immediately apply it to this project.  I have spent 407.5 hours on this project as of 11/2/23.

The website is designed to help Go players of all ranks improve their skills through the mistakes they made in their own games.  Users upload a SGF (game record) and users can ask a superhuman AI to analyze their game for the largest mistakes based on the stage of the game, and display these in a puzzle format.  If the user likes/saves the generated puzzle(s), these puzzles will also be added to the public puzzles page, where any user on the website can attempt the puzzle and learn from real game situations.  Puzzles are categorized on their theme based on user's votes, and ranked on an elo system that constantly updates based on users getting the puzzle right or wrong. Public puzzles can then be searched based on the stage of the game, category, and rank. For new players, there is also an interactive tutorial that explains the rules and fundamentals of the game.
