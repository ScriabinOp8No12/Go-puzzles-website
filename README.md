## API Documentation

### SGFs (Endpoints for current user's SGFs)

- `GET /api/sgfs/users/:user_id`: Get all SGFs of the current user (format like go4go.net)
- `POST /api/sgfs`: Upload new SGFs to the current user's SGF table
- `PUT /api/sgfs/:sgf_id`: Edit the SGF name, player names, or player ranks
- `POST /api/sgfs/:sgf_id/puzzles`: Create a new puzzle from the user's SGF (either manually or from AI's suggestion). Difficulty is calculated by
  taking the average of the two ranks of the players
  that played the game, then converting that Go rank
  into an elo rating. If there are no ranks, it'll
  default to 1500 elo (which should be around 5-7k range)
- `GET /api/sgfs/:sgf_id/puzzles/:puzzle_id/mistakes`: Get the move numbers of the best puzzles according to KataGo. Use heuristics, something like 10-12 simple rules to tell Katago how to look for a good puzzle with clear right/wrong answers!
- `DELETE /api/sgfs/:sgf_id/puzzles/puzzle_id`: Delete a puzzle that belongs to the user
- `DELETE /api/sgfs/:sgf_id`: Delete an SGF (do NOT delete the puzzles with it)

### Puzzles (Endpoints for public puzzles, which are separated from the user's puzzles created from the user's SGFs)

- `GET /api/puzzles`: Get all public puzzles with optional query parameters for rank and category filters.
- `PUT /api/puzzles/:puzzle_id`: Edit the description, category, and other info of the public puzzle (requires priviledges / reputation)
- `DELETE /api/puzzles/:puzzle_id`: Delete a public puzzle (Must be admin)

### Users (Endpoints of user specific info. Includes the user's completed puzzles and account information like user's rank, count of solved puzzles by category)

- `GET /api/users/:user_id/puzzles/completed?source=[own|public]`: Get all completed puzzles of the current user, filtered by source. The optional source query parameter can be set to own to return only puzzles created from the userâ€™s private SGFs, or public to return only puzzles created from public puzzles. If the source parameter is not provided, all completed puzzles (user's own puzzles and public puzzles) are returned.
- `GET /api/users/:user_id`: Get the user's ranking (elo), number of total puzzles completed, and a count of puzzle completed for each category

### Features for later

- `POST /api/sgfs/:sgf_id/puzzles/:puzzle_id/practice`: [OPTIONAL FOR NOW] Play against AI from a specific move and get accuracy rating
- `POST /api/puzzles/:puzzle_id/practice`: [OPTIONAL FOR NOW] Play against AI from a specific move and get accuracy rating
- `POST /api/users/:user_id/ranking`: Set initial user's ranking (don't allow it to be changed later)
- `PUT /api/users/:user_id/username`: Edit the user's username
- `PUT /api/users/:user_id/password`: Edit the user's password
- `PUT /api/users/:user_id/email`: Edit the user's email
